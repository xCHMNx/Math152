When we do this a certain number of times, according to the Collatz Conjecture, the algorithm will always converge to a pattern of $4,2,1,4,2,1...$, though this has not been formally proved. Below is the basic, un-optimized algorithm. Later we will modify it to let us explore the conjecture in greater detail."

        "Consider an arbitrary integer $n>0$ where $n$ is congruent to 1 modulo 8. That is, we have $n=8k+1$ for some integer $k\\geq 0$. Now, $n$ is odd, so the first iteration of the $3n+1$ problem will return $n'=3n+1=3(8k+1)+1=24k+4$. But we can factor $n'$ as $4(6k+1)$. This number is larger than $n$, since we multiplied by 3 and added 1. Clearly, this is an even number, so in the next step we divide by 2 to get $n''=\\frac{n'}{2}=2(6k+1)$. This number is also larger than the original, since is evaluates to $12k+2$, and this is bigger than $8k+1$. Again, we have an even value, so we divide by 2 to get $n'''=\\frac{n''}{2}=6k+1$. We are now three steps deep into the evaluation, and notice that we have obtained a number, $6k+1$, which is guaranteed to be smaller than the value we started with, namely $8k+1$. Also, neither of the previous two values could be smaller than the original. Thus, we've found that the dropping time of an integer $n$ which is congruent to 1 modulo 8 must be 3."

        "Before we run any experiments, we can again consider an analysis for arbitrary integer $n>0$ such that $n\\equiv 5 \\mod 8$. That is, $n=8k+5$ for some $k\\geq 0$. Clearly, $n$ is odd, so we first multiply by 3 and add 1 to get $n'=24k+16$. Then, we factor this as $n'=8(3k+2)$. This has three factors of 2 in it, so our next three steps will be to divide by 2. That is, $n''=4(3k+2)$, then $n^{(3)}=2(3k+2)$. As we mentioned, we could keep going. However, notice that $n^{(3)}=2(3k+2)=6k+4$ is always going to be smaller than $n=8k+5$. Since we are talking about positive integers, the smallest value $k$ can hold is 0. But if $k$ is 0, then $n$ is still larger than $n^{(3)}$. As $n$ increases in size, $k$ increases as well, but $8k+5$ grows faster than $6k+4$, meaning $6k+4$ will always be smaller. Thus, the dropping time for any integer congruent to 5 modulo 8 should be 3."

        "Let's follow a number $n>0$ such that $n\\equiv 3\\mod 16$. Then $n=16k+3$ for some $k\\geq 0$. This is odd, so $n'=3n+1=48k+10$. This can be factored as $2(24k+5)$, so $n'$ is even. Then, $n''=24k+5$. Again, this is odd, so $n^{(3)}=3n''+1=72k+16$. We can factor out 8 from this to get $8(9k+2)$. Therefore, the next three operations are to divide by 2. We get $n^{(4)}=4(9k+2)$, then $n^{(5)}=2(9k+2)$, and finally $n^{(6)}=9k+2$. Notice that $n^{(5)}$, which is $18k+4$, is still larger than $n$ regardless of $k$, but $n^{(6)}$ is always smaller. In fact, it is the first one which is smaller. Therefore, in all cases, we should obtain a dropping time of 6 for numbers congruent to 3 modulo 16."

These were numbers congruent to 1, 3, 5, 9, or 13 modulo 16. Thus, we were easily able to predict the dropping times of 5 in every 8 non-trivial integers using our analysis modulo 16. The trivial ones being those which were even to begin with. Including the even numbers, we had predictable behavior in 13 out of every 16 integers ($81.25\\%$ of them). This is a step up from conclusions we could draw from our analysis of numbers modulo 8. Recall that we were only able to easily predict the dropping times of half of the non-trivial integers after that work, namely those congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 8. Including even numbers, this meant we had predictable behavior in just 6 out of every 8 integers ($75\\%$ of them). Therefore, by expanding the number of categories we grouped numbers into, we were able to better predict the behavior of the dropping times of those numbers using their congruences. Hence it's possible that if we were to keep increasing this number of categories (the size of the modulus), we would be able to predict the dropping times of a larger and larger fraction of the integers."

As the modulus we consider increases in size, the fraction of the integers which fall into predictable dropping time patterns increases. Thus, by using a very large modulus $m$, we can predict the dropping time of a lot of the integers just by noting which value they are congruent to modulo $m$. This assumes that the patterns are noted for each potential congruence class."
